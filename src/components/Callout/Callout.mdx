# Callout

The main element made for displaying important messages and notifications. The Callout component supports multiple component states, variants, icons, and styles.

```jsx dark
import { Callout } from "@devtoti/archui-lib";

<Callout variant="info" size="md" title="Information" icon={<IconInfo />}>
  This is an informational message
</Callout>;
```

<Canvas of={AllThemes} withToolbar />

## Usage

The `Callout` component can be thought of as a stylized wrapper to be used for displaying alerts, notifications, and important information. It does not easily interfere with external logic, since all its content remains within its own scope.

Ideally, the `Callout` component can be used along with other components for displaying contextual information and user feedback. For additional examples, please refer to our practical usage section.

## Variants

- success
- info
- warning
- error
- neutral

## Examples
