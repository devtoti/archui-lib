# Button

The main element made for custom user interaction. The Button component supports multiple component states, animations, icons, and styles.

```jsx dark
import { Button } from "@devtoti/archui-lib";

<Button intent="primary" size="md" onClick={handleClick}>
  Download archUI
</Button>;
```

<Canvas of={DoricTheme} withToolbar />

## Usage

The `Button` component can be thought of as a stylized wrapper to be used with custom methods and third-party libraries. It does not easily interfere with external logic, since all its content remains within its own scope.

Ideally, the `Button` component can be used along with other components for internal and external navigation. For additional examples, please refer to our practical usage section.
