# Themes

There are three default themes in ArchUI, each with unique characteristics—**Doric**, **Ionic**, and **Corinthian**—all inspired by Ancient Greek architectural orders. Each theme offers a distinct visual identity and design language to match your project's needs.

## **Doric**

This is the `default` theme and requires no additional configuration to get started. The most straightforward of the three orders, Doric UI embodies **simplicity and balance**, prioritizing clean design over decorative elements.

With its honest and robust appearance, Doric harmonizes beautifully with:

- **Professional** brands
- **Bold** brands
- **Modern** brands
- **Retro** brands
- **Sport** brands
