# Library Setup

Installing ArchUI into your existing React project is quite easy and should not take you more than just a few minutes to setup. Follow the steps below and you'll be ready to start using and editing your favorite components.

## **Step 1: Required Packages**

Make sure you are using **React 19+** and **Tailwind CSS 4+** by heading over to your `package.json` file and checking under "dependencies".
If you don't already have the required versions listed, you'll need to update or install them before proceeding.

<Source
  dark
  language="json"
  code={`"dependencies": {
    "react": "^19.1.1",
    "react-dom": "^19.1.1",
    "tailwindcss": "^4.1.14"
}`}
/>

## **Step 2: Required Dependencies**

If you don't have Tailwind and its `postcss` and `autoprefixer` dependencies installed, run the following command:

<Source
  dark
  language="bash"
  code={`npm install tailwindcss @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer`}
/>

## **Step 3: Tailwind Setup**

Since ArchUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, you'll need to have Tailwind set up in your project. There are two common ways to add Tailwind CSS:

#### **Option A:** Automatic Setup

Create Tailwind CSS configuration files `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` with the following command:

<Source dark language="bash" code={`npx tailwindcss init -p`} />

#### **Option B:** Manual Setup

Add them manually by creating the following files: `tailwind.config.js`, `vite.config.ts`, and `postcss.config.js`, then paste the following code inside each file:

**tailwind.config.js**

<Source
  dark
  language="js"
  code={`/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: ["./index.html", "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};`}
/>

**vite.config.ts**

<Source dark language="ts" code={`import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react-swc";

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [react()],
css: {
postcss: "./postcss.config.js",
},
});`} />

**postcss.config.js**

<Source
  dark
  language="js"
  code={`export default {
  plugins: {
    "@tailwindcss/postcss": {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};`}
/>

## **Step 4: Install & Setup archUI**

Open up the CLI and install the ArchUI Library with the following command:

<Source dark language="bash" code={`npm i @devtoti/archui-lib`} />

Import the library's main CSS file directly inside `index.css`, so that your project can have access to archUI's design system:

<Source
  dark
  language="css"
  code={`@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@devtoti/archui-lib/styles";`}
/>

## **Step 5: Import Your First Component**

Now that you have configured Tailwind and the ArchUI Library, you can start using your favorite components by importing them into your React files. Additionally, you can import the Component's Type Props and adapt them to your needs:

<Source dark language="tsx" code={`import { Button } from "@devtoti/archui-lib";
import type { ButtonProps } from "@devtoti/archui-lib";

function App() {
return (

<>
  <Button intent="primary" size="md">
    Hello ArchUI !
  </Button>
  <Button intent="secondary" size="sm">
    Explore components
  </Button>
</>
); }`} />

## **Step 6: Browse Our Components**

You can now start exploring our [_repertoire_](/docs/01-components-alert--docs) of components library, or use our experimental Drag-and-Drop Playground to get a better grasp of how things work.

💡 <strong>Inspiration & Acknowledgment</strong>
ArchUI has taken great inspiration from other successful libraries such as shadcn,
kokonutui, Flowbite, chakraUI, Mantine, RewindUI, Ant Design, and MUI. We acknowledge
the value of all these great projects and encourage you to try them out if you
are not convinced by the <em>origo et ratio essendi</em> of the project.
