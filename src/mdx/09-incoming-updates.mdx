# Incoming Updates (2026)

We are working on the following updates to the ArchUI Design System, and plan to release them in the following months:

### Design System

- Add 20+ new components: Card, Accordion, Tabs, etc.
- Improve existing design tokens
- Improve existing components: Button, Callout, Alert, etc.
- Improve a11y and robustness of existing components

### ArchUI Sandbox

- Include a new tool for developers to test and experiment without having to set up a local development environment.

### Documentation

Add the following Storybook documentation pages:

- Tutorial
- Theme Customization
- Accessibility (a11y)
- Best Practices
- Glossary
- FAQ

### Figma Make

Setup the Figma UI Kit & Design System so that it can be used when creating new designs using Figma Make plugin. This will help users to:

- Quickly start a new design project from scratch
- Iterate consistently
- Create responsive designs in an instant

### Animations

Add custom, subtle animations to improve the user experience and make the components more engaging. We will use the [motion](https://motion.dev/) library to achieve this.
A few examples of animations we will add are:

- Hover effects
- Click effects
- Skeletons
