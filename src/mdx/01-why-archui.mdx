# Why ArchUI ?

There are already a ton of wonderful React component libraries out there. Probably way too many for us to count and tell.

Some of them have already gained fairly good acceptance and seem to be recognized as pretty solid alternatives when shipping new digital products.

So, you might be wondering, "Why even create another React component library when there are so many options available?" And more importantly, "What makes ArchUI worth choosing over other libraries out there?"

Most component libraries aim to improve existing design patterns and reduce the complexity that comes with tools like React or Tailwind. Their main goal is to lighten the development burden when building new apps and websites.

At first glance, choosing ArchUI over another library might seem like a simple matter of preference. However, there's a deeper philosophy behind our approach that sets us apart and might even convince you to give it a try in one of your projects:

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '2rem',
  marginBottom: '2rem',
  padding: '2rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  border: '1px solid var(--brd-primary, #e2e8f0)'
}}>

We approach web development through a transdisciplinary lens—one that breaks from traditional norms. The ArchUI Project draws inspiration from architecture, urbanism, and industrial design to shape how we craft digital experiences. It pays homage to the early architectural treatises that guided both the purpose and the process of building and engineering new structures, and that we are now revisiting and adapting to our digital world.

</div>

## Purpose

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1rem',
  marginBottom: '1rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

The ArchUI design system began as a personal experiment on how design systems work and what it takes to build and maintain them. Over time, it evolved beyond a learning exercise, gaining a broader purpose. Today, it's been made public for you to explore, use, and integrate into your own projects.

The _causa finis_ of this library is to offer a **new robust and rigorous Design System** that is inspired by the classical orders in architecture, considering:

- **Solid foundations**
- **Functionality**
- **Beauty**

We want to encourage software developers, engineers, designers, and other IT specialists to learn about the existence and value of blueprint design, and adopt this new transdisciplinary mindset into web development, particularly when shipping new digital solutions.

## Motivation

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

Imagine you are building a new React app but cannot decide which component library is right for you. You want your app to look and feel unique—not just like the rest of the apps nowadays. You are looking for something more substantial: a solution that will let you scale and bulk-modify your entire design system in the future. You value **adaptability, accessibility, uniqueness, and user experience**.

This is precisely what ArchUI is all about: a **unique, modular, and flexible library** made for shipping products fast and efficiently.

Think of ArchUI as a **shape-shifting component library**—we've built it using shared tokenized variables that easily adapt to different design contexts without messing up your app's visuals. This means you can quickly tweak and modify your themes with just a few lines of code and have your whole app change its appearance harmoniously.

Our hope for this component library is that it'll grow through a community of design enthusiasts and become a go-to alternative when you're building new web apps and websites.

## A Transdisciplinary Approach

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-accent-light, #e0e7ff)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  borderLeft: '4px solid var(--bg-accent, #3b82f6)'
}}>

**ArchUI brings an artistic, outside-the-box perspective** inspired by architecture, urbanism, and industrial design to web development. This project is a tribute to early architectural treatises that dictated why and how we should build and engineer structures.

We invite you to revisit the **Classical Design Ideals of the Greeks and Romans**, where every structure and temple began with a solid blueprint. ArchUI reintroduces that same architectural rigor into the way we craft digital products and React applications today.

## Reasons to Use ArchUI

### Modular Designs

All ArchUI components are categorized within three different modular themes, each one sharing the same variables, property names, and tokenized design system. Simply change a single class name to switch between themes and have your entire app change its appearance harmoniously.

### Blueprint Approach

Our meticulous methodology focused on blueprint design makes the whole system feel **proportionate and unique**, considering we have crafted each component with care and attention to detail.

### A11y-Lens

We care about inclusive design and our interfaces comply with **WCAG 2.0 guidelines**. We have taken care of things such as:

- Text legibility
- Color contrasts
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsiveness

## Raison d'être

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '2rem',
  marginBottom: '2rem',
  padding: '2rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-accent-light, #e0e7ff)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  borderLeft: '4px solid var(--bg-accent, #3b82f6)'
}}>

- **Modern component libraries should prioritize flexible, custom themes** that adapt to developer needs.
- **Components should utilize shared, adaptive variables** and styling attributes for consistency and maintainability.
- **Components must be both easy to import and customize**, supporting popular styling methods like Tailwind classes or dedicated style sheets.
- **Like buildings, components should be modular and accessible**: users should be able to understand and navigate them without any friction and keep on adding bricks (components) if needed.

</div>
## Before Opting for ArchUI

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-warning-light, #fef3c7)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  border: '1px solid var(--brd-warning, #fbbf24)'
}}>

Keep in mind that this is an **on-going project**, and we don't count with a lot of hands to help us design many components, nor speed up our development cycles. We are in a **slow-but-steady phase**, and we plan to continue growing our numbers and overall impact within the React community.
