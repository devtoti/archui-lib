# Why ArchUI ?

There are already a ton of wonderful React component libraries out there. Probably way too many for us to count and tell.

This might lead you to ask, "Why even create another React component library when there are so many options available?" And more importantly, "What makes ArchUI worth choosing over other libraries out there?"

At first glance, choosing ArchUI over another library might seem like a simple matter of preference. However, there's a deeper philosophy behind our approach that sets us apart and might even convince you to give it a try in one of your projects:

<div style={{ 
  padding: '0.5rem 2rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  border: '1px solid var(--brd-primary, #e2e8f0)'
}}>

We approach web development through a transdisciplinary lens—one that breaks from traditional norms. The ArchUI Project draws inspiration from architecture, urbanism, and industrial design to shape how we craft digital experiences. It pays homage to the early architectural treatises that guided both the purpose and the process of building and engineering new structures, and that we are now revisiting and adapting to our digital world.

## Purpose

The ArchUI design system began as a personal experiment on how design systems work and what it takes to build and maintain one. Over time, it evolved beyond a learning exercise, gaining a broader purpose. Today, it's been made public for you to explore, use, and integrate into your own projects.

The _causa finis_ of this library is to offer a **new robust and rigorous Design System** that is inspired by the classical orders in architecture, considering:

- **Granularity**
- **Functionality**
- **Elegance**

We want to encourage software developers, engineers, designers, and other IT specialists to adopt this new transdisciplinary mindset into web development, particularly when shipping new digital products.

## Motivation

Think of ArchUI as a **shape-shifting component library**. We've built it using shared tokenized variables that easily adapt to different design contexts without messing up your app's visuals. This means you can quickly tweak and modify your themes with just a few lines of code and have your whole app change its appearance harmoniously.

Here are some key motivations behind ArchUI:

1. **Effortless Theming:** Easily switch and customize design themes across your project with minimal code changes, thanks to our unified token system.
2. **Consistency at Scale:** Maintain visual and functional consistency across large applications, reducing design debt and rework.
3. **Faster Prototyping:** Rapidly build and iterate new ideas or layouts without worrying about breaking the core design foundation.
4. **Community Driven:** Our hope for this component library is that it'll grow through a community of design enthusiasts and become a go-to alternative when you're building new web apps and websites.

## Transdisciplinary Approach

<div style={{ 
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '0.5rem 2rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-accent-light, #e0e7ff)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  borderLeft: '4px solid var(--bg-accent, #3b82f6)'
}}>

**ArchUI brings an artistic, outside-the-box perspective** inspired by architecture, urbanism, and industrial design to web development. This project is a tribute to early architectural treatises that dictated why and how we should build and engineer structures.

We invite you to revisit the **Classical Design Ideals of the Greeks and Romans**, where every structure and temple began with a solid blueprint. ArchUI reintroduces that same architectural rigor into the way we craft digital products and React applications today.

## Reasons to opt for ArchUI

### Modular Designs

All ArchUI components are categorized within three different modular themes, each one sharing the same variables, property names, and tokenized design system. Simply change a single class name to switch between themes and have your entire app change its appearance harmoniously.

### Blueprint Approach

Our meticulous methodology focused on blueprint design makes the whole system feel **proportionate and unique**, considering we have crafted each component with care and attention to detail.

### A11y-Lens

We care about inclusive design and our interfaces comply with **WCAG 2.0 guidelines**. We have taken care of things such as:

- Text legibility
- Color contrasts
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsiveness

## Raison d'être

- **Modern component libraries should prioritize flexible, custom themes** that adapt to developer needs.
- **Components should utilize shared, adaptive variables** and styling attributes for consistency and maintainability.
- **Components must be both easy to import and customize**, supporting popular styling methods like Tailwind classes or dedicated style sheets.
- **Like buildings, components should be modular and accessible**: users should be able to understand and navigate them without any friction and keep on adding bricks (components) if needed.
