# Why archUI?

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '2rem',
  marginBottom: '2rem',

The React ecosystem is filled with excellent component libraries—some widely recognized and trusted for building digital products. So why create another one? What makes archUI worth choosing?

Most component libraries aim to simplify development and reduce complexity. At first glance, choosing archUI might seem like a matter of preference. However, there's a deeper philosophy behind our approach that sets us apart.

## A Transdisciplinary Approach

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',

  borderRadius: '8px',

**ArchUI brings an artistic, outside-the-box perspective** inspired by architecture, urbanism, and industrial design to web development. This project is a tribute to early architectural treatises that dictated why and how we should build and engineer structures.

We invite you to revisit the **Classical Design Ideals of the Greeks and Romans**, where every structure and temple began with a solid blueprint. ArchUI reintroduces that same architectural rigor into the way we craft digital products and React applications today.

💡 **Inspiration & Acknowledgment**

ArchUI has taken great inspiration from other successful libraries such as shadcn, kokonutui, Flowbite, chakraUI, Mantine, RewindUI, Ant Design, and MUI. We acknowledge the value of all these great projects and encourage you to try them out if you are not convinced by the _origo et ratio essendi_ of the project.

The ArchUI design system began as a personal experiment on how design systems work and what it takes to build and maintain them. Over time, it evolved beyond a learning exercise, gaining a broader purpose. Today, it's been made public for you to explore, use, and integrate into your own projects.

The _causa finis_ of this library is to offer a **new robust and rigorous Design System** that is inspired by the classical orders in architecture, considering:

- **Solid foundations**
- **Functionality**
- **Beauty**

We want to encourage software developers, engineers, designers, and other IT specialists to learn about the existence and value of blueprint design, and adopt this new transdisciplinary mindset into web development, particularly when shipping new digital solutions.

## Motivation

<div style={{

Imagine you are building a new React app but cannot decide which component library is right for you. You want your app to look and feel unique—not just like the rest of the apps nowadays. You are looking for something more substantial: a solution that will let you scale and bulk-modify your entire design system in the future. You value **adaptability, accessibility, uniqueness, and user experience**.

This is precisely what archUI is all about: a **unique, modular, and super-flexible library** made for shipping products fast and efficiently.

Think of archUI as a **shape-shifting component library**—we've built it using shared tokenized variables that easily adapt to different design contexts without messing up your app's visuals. This means you can quickly tweak and modify your themes with just a few lines of code and have your whole app change its appearance harmoniously.

Our hope for this component library is that it'll grow through a community of design enthusiasts and become a go-to alternative when you're building new web apps and websites.

## Reasons to Use archUI

### 🎨 Modular Designs Ready to Be Used

All archUI components are categorized within three different modular themes, each one sharing the same variables, property names, and tokenized design system.

### ♿ Accessibility Matters

We care about inclusive design and our interfaces comply with **WCAG 2.0 guidelines**. We have taken care of things such as:

- Text legibility
- Color contrasts
- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Responsiveness

### 🏛️ A New Approach to UI Design and Software Development

Our component styles have been inspired by famous treatises from Classical Architecture, which makes the whole system feel **proportionate and unique**.

## Before Opting for archUI

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-warning-light, #fef3c7)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  border: '1px solid var(--brd-warning, #fbbf24)'
}}>

Keep in mind that this is an **on-going project**, and we don't count with a lot of hands to help us design many components, nor speed up our development cycles. We are in a **slow-but-steady phase**, and we plan to continue growing our numbers and overall impact within the React community.

## Raison d'être

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '2rem',
  marginBottom: '2rem',
  padding: '2rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-accent-light, #e0e7ff)',
  borderRadius: '8px',
  borderLeft: '4px solid var(--bg-accent, #3b82f6)'
}}>

Our core principles:

- **Modern libraries should prioritize flexible, custom themes** that adapt to developer needs.
- **Components should utilize shared, adaptive variables** and styling attributes for consistency and maintainability.
- **Like architectural orders, themes should support mixed styles** to create new harmonious compositions while maintaining visual coherence.
- **Components must be both easy to import and customize**, supporting popular styling methods like Tailwind classes or dedicated style sheets.
- **Like buildings, components should be modular and accessible**: users should be able to understand and navigate them without any friction and keep on adding bricks (components) if needed.
