This glossary provides definitions for key architectural and design terms used throughout the archUI documentation and design system. Understanding these concepts will help you better appreciate the philosophy and structure of archUI.

## Greek Ideals

**Greek Ideals** refer to the fundamental principles of beauty, proportion, and harmony that guided classical Greek architecture and art. These ideals emphasized:

- **Proportion**: The mathematical relationships between different parts of a structure
- **Symmetry**: Balanced and harmonious arrangements
- **Clarity**: Clear visual hierarchy and communication
- **Elegance**: Refined aesthetics that stand the test of time

In archUI, we apply these same principles to digital design, ensuring that components are well-proportioned, harmonious, and elegant.

## Architecture Treatise

<div style={{

  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

An **Architecture Treatise** is a formal written work that documents architectural principles, rules, and guidelines. Historically, treatises like Vitruvius's _De architectura_ and later works by Renaissance architects established the foundational rules for classical architecture.

ArchUI draws inspiration from these treatises by establishing clear design principles, component patterns, and styling guidelines that serve as the "blueprint" for building consistent digital interfaces.

## Orders

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',

}}>

**Orders** (also known as architectural orders) are the classical styles of column design in ancient Greek and Roman architecture. Each order has distinct characteristics, proportions, and decorative elements that define its visual identity.

In archUI, we use the concept of orders to represent our three main themes: **Doric**, **Ionic**, and **Corinthian**. Each theme follows specific design principles while maintaining harmony within the overall design system.

</div>

## Doric

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

**Doric** is the oldest and most straightforward of the three classical Greek architectural orders. Characterized by:

- Simple, sturdy columns without bases
- Plain, fluted shafts
- Minimal decorative elements
- Strong, masculine appearance

In archUI, the Doric theme embodies **simplicity and balance**, prioritizing clean design over decorative elements. It features sharp edges, contrasting borders, and a sturdier appearance—perfect for professional, bold, and modern brands.

</div>

## Ionic

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

**Ionic** is the second classical Greek architectural order, known for its elegance and grace. Distinguished by:

- Slender columns with bases
- Volutes (spiral scrolls) on the capitals
- More decorative than Doric
- Feminine, graceful appearance

In archUI, the Ionic theme is the **default theme** and creates a welcoming, visually engaging user experience. It features rounded corners, generous padding, borderless design, and soft shadows—ideal for calm, innovative, warm & inviting, playful, and beauty brands.

</div>

## Corinthian

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

**Corinthian** is the most elaborate and decorative of the three classical Greek architectural orders. Recognized by:

- Ornate capitals decorated with acanthus leaves
- Slender, elegant columns
- Rich decorative details
- Sophisticated, luxurious appearance

In archUI, the Corinthian theme embodies **sophistication and refined elegance**. It features subtle rounded corners, delicate padding, light-gray borders, rich ornamental details, gradient backgrounds, and a slender appearance—perfect for luxury, elegant, sophisticated, premium, and artistic brands.

</div>

## Composite

<div style={{ 
  marginTop: '1.5rem',
  marginBottom: '1.5rem',
  padding: '1.5rem',
  backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-secondary, #f8f9fa)',
  borderRadius: '8px'
}}>

**Composite** is a Roman architectural order that combines elements from both Ionic and Corinthian orders. It features:

- Volutes from the Ionic order
- Acanthus leaves from the Corinthian order
- The most ornate and decorative style
- A synthesis of previous orders

While archUI currently focuses on the three primary Greek orders (Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian), the Composite order represents the potential for future theme variations that combine characteristics from multiple orders, allowing for even more sophisticated and customized design systems.
